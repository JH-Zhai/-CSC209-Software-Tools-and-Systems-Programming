Question 2: Short answer

[2 marks]
a) In Assignment 1, the image files were stored as text files.  The set of 
   10,000 test images required approximately 39 megabytes of space.  For 
   Assignment 2, the image files were stored in binary format, and the same set 
   of 10,000 test images required approximately 7 megabytes of space.

   Explain why we need so much less space to store the same images in binary 
   format. Be precise, and include concrete examples.

ANSWER: 
binary file is smaller to store same info. 
example:
binary file don't need space for space
text: 1 1 1
binary: 111

binary file with use 1 byte for 1 unsigned char like 255, text file with 4 bytes for 1 integer.

b) Provide a declaration for the variables x and y so the following code will 
   compile correctly:

char *mystery(int i, int j) {
    // body of the function omitted.
}

x = mystery;
y = mystery(3, 4);

DECLARATION for x: 

char* (*x) (int i, int j);

DECLARATION for y: 
char *y;
