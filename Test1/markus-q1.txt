a)[1 mark] Why was it not possible to declare the dataset array or the labels 
array in A1 as a local variable to main?

ANSWER:
The dataset array was too large to store on the stack.

We also accepted answers that said that it was not possible for other functions
to use the dataset array if it was declared in main.


b)[1 mark] Write a small snippet of C code (< 5 lines) that is an example of 
a memory leak.

ANSWER:
The answer must demonstrate that it is no longer possible dereference 
the memory that is lost.  There are many different ways to do this.

int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));
ptr = NULL;


c)[1 mark] Write a small snippet of C code (< 5 lines) that is an example of 
a dangling pointer.

ANSWER:
It isn't a dangling pointer unless it is actually used (dereferenced) after 
it is freed.  It is not sufficient to just call free.

int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));
free(ptr);
*ptr = 10;


d)[1 mark] Write a small snippet of C code (< 5 lines) that would be certain 
to generate a segmentation fault.

ANSWER:

int *ptr = NULL;
*ptr = 10;

char *str = "literal";
str[0] = 'z';
