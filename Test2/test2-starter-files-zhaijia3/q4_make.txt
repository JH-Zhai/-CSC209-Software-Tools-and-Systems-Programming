Question 4: Make

Consider the following makefile:
=====================================================
all : server client                     # Rule 0

server : server.o wrapper.o helper.o    # Rule 1
    gcc -Wall -o $@ $^                  # Action 1

client : client.o helper.o              # Rule 2
    gcc -Wall -o $@ $^                  # Action 2

%.o : %.c                               # Rule 3
    gcc -Wall -c $<                     # Action 3

clean :                                 # Rule 4
    rm *.o server client                # Action 4
=====================================================

The current working directory initially contains the following files,
and all of the .c files #include "helper.h"

Makefile        helper.h        wrapper.c
client.c        helper.c        server.c

The commands in the following questions are executed in sequence, so each may 
depend on the results of the previous commands. For each question state which 
action lines are run or if there is an error, and state which files are created,
updated, or deleted. If no files are created or modified, write None.

a) make helper.o
